Inside this directory, the react files generated on built (index.html, static, etc) will be placed.
Once the collectstatic django command is executed (on prod deployment), this files will be moved to the S3 bucket
from where they will be served. The bucket is specially configured to serve a website.

All this process happens inside the "django" docker container.
